# Assignment: Data Validation with TensorFlow (TFDV)

## Project Overview
This project utilizes [TensorFlow Data Validation (TFDV)](https://cloud.google.com/solutions/machine-learning/analyzing-and-validating-data-at-scale-for-ml-using-tfx), an open-source library designed for understanding, validating, and monitoring machine learning data at scale. TFDV is instrumental in analyzing datasets in various stages, such as training, evaluation, and serving, ensuring consistency and detecting potential issues like training/serving skew.

## Objectives
In this lab, participants will gain hands-on experience with TFDV to accomplish the following tasks:
- Generate and visualize statistics from a DataFrame.
- Infer a dataset schema.
- Identify, visualize, and resolve data anomalies.

## Table of Contents
1. **Setup and Imports**
2. **Load the Dataset**
   - Read and Split the Dataset
   - Data Splits and Label Column
3. **Generate and Visualize Training Data Statistics**
   - Removing Irrelevant Features
   - Exercises to generate and visualize training statistics
4. **Infer a Data Schema**
   - Exercises to infer the training set schema
5. **Calculate, Visualize, and Fix Evaluation Anomalies**
   - Exercises focused on comparing statistics and fixing anomalies
6. **Schema Environments**
   - Exercises for checking anomalies and modifying domain
7. **Check for Data Drift and Skew**
8. **Display Stats for Data Slices**
9. **Freeze the Schema**

## Target Audience
This project is designed for data scientists, ML engineers, and anyone interested in understanding and improving the quality of their machine learning datasets.

## How to Use
Follow the exercises in the provided Jupyter notebooks, starting with the setup and progressing through data loading, visualization, schema inference, anomaly detection, and resolution. Each section includes practical exercises to apply TFDV functionalities on real-world data.
